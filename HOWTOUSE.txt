HOW TO SET UP:
Change the IPs in dns_zones.json and dns_zones-hosts.txt to the ones your BedrockConnect server is using.
Install the latest version of Python. After it's all done, execute these commands

pip install dnslib requests pyinstaller

pyinstaller RiiConnect24-DNS-Server.spec

then run the exe that's inside the dist folder.

Set up the DNS as you normally would.
